# pegLIT multithreads running script

[pegRNA Linker Identification Tool (pegLIT)](https://github.com/sshen8/peglit), a powerful tool developed by David Liu lab, can automatically identify non-interfering nucleotide linkers between a pegRNA and 3' motif.

Here we wrote some custom scripts to run peglit with high efficiency, using multithreads.
